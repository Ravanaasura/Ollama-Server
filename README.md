## Docker Deployment

The project supports Docker deployment, making it easy to quickly set up in various environments.

### Deployment with Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/forrany/Awesome-Ollama-Server.git
cd Awesome-Ollama-Server
```

3. Create an environment variable file (if using Upstash Redis data storage)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file and fill in the Upstash Redis credentials:

```
UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN=your_redis_token
```

4. Start the Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start two services:
- `ollama-monitor`: A web application, viewable at http://localhost:3000
- `monitor-service`: A background monitoring service that automatically collects Ollama service data

### Deploying with Docker Only

If you only need to deploy a web application and don't need a backend monitoring service:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t ollama-monitor .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name ollama-monitor \
-e UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=your_redis_url \
-e UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN=your_redis_token \
ollama-monitor
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view the application.
